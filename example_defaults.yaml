# Path should define a keyword defined in paths.
# This will be used as the default path
path: local
paths:
    local: /path/to/local_data/
    remote: /path/to/remote_data/

# Here path is a keyword which has to be in paths,
# this allows easy use of multiple paths by using
# the -P flag in either script to specify
#
# ./airway-pipeline.py -P remote 
# or
# ./airway-vis.py -P remote 
#
# when you want to work on the remote data path
# without having to write out the entire path.
# Remove 'remote' if you only have a single data location.
# You may also define as many as you need.
# 
# The reason for this is to have a small file sample on
# local machine on an SSD for easy debugging, and then
# the full data on a remote NAS. Allowing easy switching
# between paths.


# Number of threads to be used, note that each patient
# only ever gets 1 thread, so all paralelization is per
# patient. Increase this if you have more threads.
workers: 8

# Whether data should be overwritten by rerunning stages
# generally useful to set it to True, but for safety 
# False is used as default
force: False

# Whether only a single patient should computed all
# the time. Generally no reason to change this.
single: False

# May be specified to use a different executable for 
# Blender (such as /usr/bin/blender or /snap/bin/blender)
# Both Blender <=2.79 and >=2.80 should work, although if it
# doesn't you may specify a different version here.
# Will not be needed if you never use blender in this project.
